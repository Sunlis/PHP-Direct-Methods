PHP-Direct-Methods
==================

Simple framework to provide a Javascript call for PHP methods

# Usage

Throw the provided code into any directory on your server. Navigate to test.html to see it in action.

# Customization

The framework is very simple, so it should be pretty easy to find the code change needed to make it your own. If you simply want to add a new direct method, copy classes/example.direct.class.php. Once you've made your new class, there's no extra set-up needed - you can start using it in Javascript immediately.
